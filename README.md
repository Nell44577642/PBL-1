### AI Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Group Members : Bultez Charlotte, Ito-Russo Kana, Ribeiro Nell, Raux Lily

### 1. Project Overview

Our application is a Tic-Tac-Toe engine that uses a Minimax algorithm to simulate a full tree of game possibilities. The goal was to solve the problem of optimal decision-making in a zero-sum environment, creating an AI that evaluates every potential move to ensure it never loses. We built this to practice implementing recursive search patterns and to understand how heuristic functions can be used to score game states in real-time."
